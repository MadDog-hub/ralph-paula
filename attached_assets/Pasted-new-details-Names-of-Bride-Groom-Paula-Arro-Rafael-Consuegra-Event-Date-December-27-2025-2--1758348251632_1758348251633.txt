new story:
Part 1: Paula’s Beginning

June 27, 1991.
Paula was born at San Juan de Dios Hospital—into a world already full of love and laughter. Growing up, she shared dreams and secrets with her sisters, surrounded by the warmth of family and the values their parents instilled: love, hard work, and quiet strength.

From early on, Paula was determined. After college, she threw herself into her career—ambitious, driven, and committed to making a difference. Her dreams were big, but her feet stayed firmly on the ground.

She wasn’t looking for love.

Then came one rainy day.

It was ordinary—until it wasn’t.
In the course of her work, with her usual focus and fire, she met a man named Rafael.

Part 2: Rafael’s Beginning

October 24, 1989.
Rafael was born in the quiet town of Tobacco, Albay. The youngest of four siblings, his life mirrored something out of the movie 7 Sundays—his older siblings already raising families of their own, and Rafael often left to find his own way.

He didn’t mind. He learned early on to stand alone and keep moving forward. He believed in hard work over luck, and his personal motto was simple but powerful:

“Don’t wait for miracles—work for them.”

He studied BS Marine Engineering as a scholar and dean’s lister, fought his way through delays and detours, and earned every step of his journey toward the sea. That journey eventually brought him to a training center.

And fate brought him to Paula.
Part 3: The First Meeting

August 7, 2019.
Rafael walked into the training facility where Paula worked. He was eager, fresh-faced, and determined to get into the earliest batch. He approached her with a grin that could rival the morning sun and, without much preamble, asked for help with his paperwork.

She barely looked up.

Busy. Focused. Annoyed.

His timing was off, his confidence a little too much, and his assumption that she’d drop everything? That didn’t sit well. Her brow furrowed. Her lips thinned. Her stare was sharp enough to send most people running.

But Rafael? He just smiled.

That same mischievous smile that, in time, would become familiar—and surprisingly hard to stay mad at.

To Paula, he was just another impatient trainee.
To Rafael, she was a no-nonsense staff member who clearly didn’t play games.

Neither of them knew it yet, but that moment—the clash of his grin and her glare—was the beginning of something they’d both come to cherish.
Part 4: A Love Across Distance

Then, the world changed.

The pandemic came. Everything stopped.

Rafael found himself on a ship, isolated in the middle of the South American sea. The days blurred. The silence stretched. And in that vast stillness, one name came to mind: Paula.

No big speech. No clever words. Just a quiet instinct to reach out.
He typed: “Hi Ma’am, kumusta? 😁”

On land, Paula had already shifted fields, adapting like she always did—strong, capable, focused. When she saw the message, she paused, confused. Then, she replied.

A small message. Then another.

Quietly, something began.

What started as casual check-ins became daily conversations. Over time, they shared more than just words—they shared thoughts, hopes, parts of themselves.

From opposite sides of the sea, they started to orbit each other.

It wasn’t a whirlwind romance. It wasn’t perfect. There were misunderstandings. Long-distance calls. Busy days. Missed messages. Life almost pulled them in different directions.

But every time, they found their way back.
Part 5: Choosing Each Other

Rafael, with his quiet strength and consistent presence, showed Paula that love isn’t always loud—it’s steady. It shows up. Even when it’s inconvenient.

And Paula, with her spark, her heart, and her unstoppable drive, showed Rafael that love doesn’t have to be a detour—it can be a shared path, one that makes the journey richer.

Now, four years later,
They stand before us—hand in hand, hearts open, eyes full of shared dreams.

They smile at each other, then at us, and say:

“We made it.”

Not because it was easy.
But because they chose each other—again and again.
